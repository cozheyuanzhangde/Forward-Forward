# Hinton's Forward-Forward Algorithm
## What is Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm?
FF is an alternative deep learning algorithm to Backpropagation (BP).

## Progress:
- [x] Supervised Learning for MNIST dataset (initial code from mohammadpz/pytorch_forward_forward)
- [x] Reorganization
- [x] Batch Training
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning for MNIST dataset
- [ ] Receptive Fields
- [ ] Language Modeling
